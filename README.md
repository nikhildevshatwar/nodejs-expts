# Nodejs experiments
All trial example codes that I developed while learning nodejs and web technologies.

**WARNING** This is amatuer level coding. This might be completely off the standards, inefficient and totally unsecure code. Do not use it for million doller systems.

## ImageMagic server
Simple http server to experiment with ImageMagick Node.js module
This is supposed to use server side computing to process images.

Install the required modules and packages
``` bash
sudo apt-get install nodejs npm
npm install imagemagick
```
